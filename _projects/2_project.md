# Sorting bad laundry

The founder of this application was flustered with the disorganization of his wordrobe, so he developed this app in order to figure out how to best fold his laundry.  Unfortunatly, he was also flustered with the disorganization of the app's initial UI.  I was happy to help come in and redesign the app.  After the launch of the redesign, the app saw:

- higher adoption rates among target audience
- shorter initial engagement periods, coupled with higher click-through rates
- higher daily active users
